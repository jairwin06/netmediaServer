### Networked Media Week 5 Assignment

This project aims to use the Beatles song "I Am The Walrus" as a body of text in which case the subject (and possibly the inferred meaning) changes based on an array or values. I started to work with forms as well, so users can input their own subject for the song. The next step would be to dynamically update the array with user input so a database of random subjects could be called at any time and the resulting lyrics will constantly change. 

Working with text was a nice baseline to start getting comfortable with templating.
